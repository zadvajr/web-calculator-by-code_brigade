## Introduction
### Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed design for the development of a web-based calculator application.

### Scope
The calculator will support basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, clear screen, percentage, double zero entry, and triple zero entry.
Audience: This document is intended for the development team and stakeholders involved in the project.


## System Overview
 ### Description
The calculator will be implemented as a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### User Interface
The calculator will have a user-friendly interface that allows users to input numbers and perform calculations.


## Architectural Design
### Front-end
The user interface will be developed using HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for the interactive functionality.

### Back-end
The calculator will be implemented as a client-side application, meaning that all calculations will be performed on the user's browser.


## User Interface Design
### Layout
The calculator interface will consist of a display area to show the input and output, along with buttons for numbers and operations.

### Input Handling
The calculator will respond to user input through button clicks or keyboard input, allowing users to enter numbers and perform calculations.


## Calculation Logic
### Operation Handling
The calculator will support basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Error Handling
The calculator will handle error scenarios, such as division by zero, and display appropriate error messages to the user.


## Testing
### Unit Testing
Each component of the calculator will be thoroughly tested to ensure its functionality and correctness.

### Integration Testing
The interaction between different components will be tested to ensure they work together seamlessly.

### User Acceptance Testing
The calculator will be tested with end-users to gather feedback and identify any usability issues.
